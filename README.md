Scripts and notebooks used to (i) track and derive statistics of deep convective clouds in the ICON km-scale climate model, (ii) perform inital results analysis, and (iii) produce the figures presented in the manuscript "Convective controls on anvil cloud evolution in the ICON km-scale global climate model" by Mathilde Ritman, William K Jones and Philip Stier, which is to be submitted to Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).

(i) can be found in the folder 'global3d_track'

(ii) can be found in the folder 'data_analysis'
